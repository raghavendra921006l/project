First, the use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices. Second, a mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not incapacitate the entire system. Third, there is the advantage of privacy or security. When every message travels along a dedicated line, only the intended recipient sees it. Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages. Finally, point to point links make fault identification and fault isolation easy. Traffic can be routed to avoid links with suspected problems. This facility enables the network manager to discover the precise location of the fault and aids in finding its cause and solution.</p><p>The main disadvantages of a mesh are related to the amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports required. First, because every device must be connected to every other device, installation and reconnection are difficult. Second, the sheer bulk of the wiring can be greater than the available space (in walls, ceilings, or floors) can accommodate. Finally, the hardware required to connect each link (I/O ports and cable) can be prohibitively expensive. For these reasons a mesh topology is usually implemented in a limited fashion, for example, as a backbone connecting the main computers of a hybrid network that can include several other topologies.', '64', 1, 56, 0, '2014-11-01 04:26:41', 0),

In a star, each device needs only one link and one I/O port to connect it to any number of others. This factor also makes it easy to install and reconfigure. Far less cabling needs to be housed, and additions, moves, and deletions involve only one connection: between that device and the hub. Other advantages include robustness. If one link fails, only that link is affected. All other links remain active. This factor also lends itself to easy fault identification andfault isolation. As long as the hub is working, it can be used to monitor link problems and bypass defective links.</p><p>One big disadvantage of a star topology is the dependency of the whole topology on one single point, the hub. If the hub goes down, the whole system is dead. Although a star requires far less cable than a mesh, each node must be linked to a central hub. For this reason, often more cabling is required in a star than in some other topologies (such as ring or bus). The star topology is used in local area networks (LANs).

One long cable acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network.Nodes are connected to the bus cable by drop lines and taps. A drop line is a connection running between the device and the main cable. A tap is a connector that either splices into the main cable or punctures the sheathing of a cable to create a contact with the metallic core. As a signal travels along the backbone, some of its energy is transformed into heat. Therefore, it becomes weaker and weaker as it travels farther and farther. For this reason there is a limit on the number of taps a bus can support and on the distance between those taps.</p><p>Advantages of a bus topology include ease of installation. Backbone cable can be laid along the most efficient path, then connected to the nodes by drop lines of various lengths. In this way, a bus uses less cabling than mesh or star topologies. In a star, for example, four network devices in the same room require four lengths of cable reaching all the way to the hub. In a bus, this redundancy is eliminated. Only the backbone cable stretches through the entire facility. Each drop line has to reach only as far as the nearest point on the backbone.</p><p>Disadvantages include difficult reconnection and fault isolation. A bus is usually designed to be optimally efficient at installation. It can therefore be difficult to add new devices. Signal reflection at the taps can cause degradation in quality. This degradation can be controlled by limiting the number and spacing of devices connected to a given length of cable.

The only constraints are media and traffic considerations (maximum ring length and number of devices). In addition, fault isolation is simplified. Generally in a ring, a signal is circulating at all times. If one device does not receive a signal within a specified period, it can issue an alarm. The alarm alerts the network operator to the problem and its location.</p><p>However, unidirectional traffic can be a disadvantage.

It is included in the frame used by the data link layer. It is the lowest level address.</p><p>The physical addresses have authority over the network (LAN or WAN). The size and format of these addresses vary depending on the network. For example, Ethernet uses a 6 byte (48 bit) physical address that is imprinted on the network interface card (NIC). LocalTalk (Apple), however, has a I byte dynamic address that changes each time the station comes up.</p><p><strong>2.Logical Addresses:</strong>Logical addresses are necessary for universal communications that are independent of underlying physical networks. Physical addresses are not adequate in an internetwork environment where different networks can have different address formats. A universal addressing system is needed in which each host can be identified uniquely, regardless of the underlying physical network. The logical addresses are designed for this purpose. A logical address in the Internet is currently a 32 bit address that can uniquely define a host connected to the Internet. No two publicly addressed and visible hosts on the Internet can have the same IP address.</p><p><strong>3.Port Addresses:</strong> The IP address and the physical address are necessary for a quantity of data to travel from a source to the destination host. However, arrival at the destination host is not the final objective of data communications on the Internet. A system that sends nothing but data from one computer to another is not complete. Today, computers are devices that can run multiple processes at the same time. The end objective of Internet communication is a process communicating with another process. For example, computer A can communicate with computer C by using TELNET. At the same time, computer A communicates with computer B by using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). For these processes to receive data simultaneously, we need a method to label the different processes. In other words, they need addresses. In the TCPIIP architecture, the label assigned to a process is called a port address. A port address in TCPIIP is 16 bits in length.</p><p><strong>4.Specific Addresses</strong> Some applications have user friendly addresses that are designed for that specific address. Examples include the e mail address (for example, contact_us@lastdaystudy.com) and the Universal Resource Locator (URL) (for example, www.lastdaystudy.com). The first defines the recipient of an e mail; the second is used to find a document on the World Wide Web.

Distortion can occur in a composite signal made of different frequencies.Each signal component has its own propagation speed through a medium and, therefore, its own delay in arriving at the final destination. Differences in delay may create a difference in phase if the delay is not exactly the same as the period duration. In other words, signal components at the receiver have phases different from what they had at the sender. The shape of the composite signal is therefore not the same.</p><p><img src="http://lastdaystudy.com/media/images/distortion.GIF" alt="Distortion" width="580" height="228" style="display: block; margin left: auto; margin right: auto;" /></p><p><strong>Noise</strong> is another cause of impairment. Several types of noise, such as thermal noise, induced noise, crosstalk, and impulse noise, may corrupt the signal. Thermal noise is the random motion of electrons in a wire which creates an extra signal not originally sent by the transmitter. Induced noise comes from sources such as motors and appliances. These devices act as a sending antenna, and the transmission medium acts as the receiving antenna. Crosstalk is the effect of one wire on the other. One wire acts as a sending antenna and the other as the receiving antenna. Impulse noise is a spike (a signal with high energy in a very short time) that comes from power lines, lightning, and so on.</p><p><img src="http://lastdaystudy.com/media/images/noise.GIF" alt="Noise.GIF" width="580" height="230" style="display: block; margin left: auto; margin right: auto;" />', '64', 1, 56, 0, '2014-11-01 04:26:41', 0),

Carrier frequencies are separated by sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the modulated signal. These bandwidth ranges are the channels through which the various signals travel. Channels can be separated by strips of unused bandwidth i.e <strong>guard bands,</strong> to prevent signals from overlapping.

If we have n connections, a frame is divided into n time slots and one slot is allocated for each unit, one for each input line. If the duration of the input unit is T, the duration of each slot is Tin and the duration of each frame is T (unless a frame carries some other information, as we will see shortly). The data rate of the output link must be n times the data rate of a connection to guarantee the flow of data.Time slots are grouped into frames. A frame consists of one complete cycle of time slots, with one slot dedicated to each sending device.

Twisted pair and coaxial cable use metallic (copper) conductors that accept and transport signals in the form of electric current. Optical fiber is a cable that accepts and transports signals in the form of light.</p><p><strong>1.Twisted Pair Cable</strong>:A twisted pair consists of two conductors (normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together.One of the wires is used to carry signals to the receiver, and the other is used only as a ground reference. The receiver uses the difference between the two. In addition to the signal sent by the sender on one of the wires, interference (noise) and crosstalk may affect both wires and create unwanted signals. If the two wires are parallel, the effect of these unwanted signals is not the same in both wires because they are at different locations relative to the noise or crosstalk sources (e,g., one is closer and the other is farther). This results in a difference at the receiver. By twisting the pairs, a balance is maintained. For example, suppose in one twist, one wire is closer to the noise source and the other is farther; in the next twist, the reverse is true. Twisting makes it probable that both wires are equally affected by external influences (noise or crosstalk). This means that the receiver, which calculates the difference between the two, receives no unwanted signals. The unwanted signals are mostly canceled out. From the above discussion, it is clear that the number of twists per unit of length has some effect on the quality of the cable.</p><p><img src="http://lastdaystudy.com/media/images/twisted pair.GIF" alt="Twisted Pair cable" width="500" height="89" style="display: block; margin left: auto; margin right: auto;" /></p><p><strong>2.Coaxial cable</strong> carries signals of higher frequency ranges than those in twisted pair cable, in part because the two media are constructed quite differently. Instead ofhaving two wires, it has a central core conductor of solid or stranded wire (usually copper) enclosed in an insulating sheath, which is, in turn, encased in an outer conductor of metal foil, braid, or a combination of the two. The outer metallic wrapping serves both as a shield against noise and as the second conductor, which completes the circuit. This outer conductor is also enclosed in an insulating sheath, and the whole cable is protected by a plastic cover.</p><p><img src="http://lastdaystudy.com/media/images/coaxial.GIF" alt="Coaxial Cable" width="327" height="143" style="display: block; margin left: auto; margin right: auto;" /></p><p><strong>3.Fiber Optic Cable:</strong> A fiber optic cable is made of glass or plastic and transmits signals in the form of light. To understand optical fiber, we first need to explore several aspects of the nature of light. Light travels in a straight line as long as it is moving through a single uniform substance. If a ray of light traveling through one substance suddenly enters another substance (of a different density), the ray changes direction.Optical fibers use reflection to guide light through a channel. A glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic. The difference in density of the two materials must be such that a beam of light moving through the core is reflected off the cladding instead of being refracted into it.</p><p><img src="http://lastdaystudy.com/media/images/optical.GIF" alt="Optical fibre" width="363" height="116" style="display: block; margin left: auto; margin right: auto;" />', '64', 1, 56, 0, '2014-11-01 04:26:41', 0),

A beam of light moves through this constant density in a straight line until it reaches the interface of the core and the cladding.

However, the behavior of the waves, rather than the frequencies, is a better criterion for classification.<br /> Radio waves, for the most part, are<strong> omnidirectional</strong>. When an antenna transmits radio waves, they are propagated in all directions. This means that the sending and receiving antennas do not have to be aligned. A sending antenna sends waves that can be received by any receiving antenna. The omnidirectional property has a disadvantage, too. The radio waves transmitted by one antenna are susceptible to interference by another antenna that may send signals using the same frequency or band. Radio waves,in the sky mode,can travel long distances.<br /> <strong>Applications </strong><br />The omnidirectional characteristics of radio waves make them useful for multicasting, in which there is one sender but many receivers.

Microwaves are unidirectional. When an antenna transmits microwave waves, they can be narrowly focused. This means that the sending and receiving antennas need to be aligned. The unidirectional property has an obvious advantage. A pair of antennas can be aligned without interfering with another pair of aligned antennas. The following describes some characteristics of microwave propagation:</p><p style="padding left: 15px;"><strong>1.</strong>Microwave propagation is <strong>line of sight</strong>. Since the towers with the mounted antennas need to be in direct sight of each other, towers that are far apart need to be very tall. The curvature of the earth as well as other blocking obstacles do not allow two short towers to communicate by using microwaves. Repeaters are often needed for long distance communication.<br /><strong>2.</strong>Very high frequency microwaves cannot penetrate walls.

This advantageous characteristic prevents interference between one system and another; a short range communication system in one room cannot be affected by another system in the next room. When we use our infrared remote control, we do not interfere with the use of the remote by our neighbors. However, this same characteristic makes infrared signals useless for long range communication.

We introduce two protocols for this type of channel. The first is a protocol that does not use flow control; the second is the one that does. Of course, neither has error control because we have assumed that the channel is a perfect noiseless channel.</p><p><strong>Simplest Protocol</strong><br /> Our first protocol, which we call the Simplest Protocol for lack of any other name, is one that has no flow or error control. Like other protocols we will discuss in this chapter, it is a unidirectional protocol in which data frames are traveling in only one direction from the sender to receiver. We assume that the receiver can immediately handle any frame it receives with a processing time that is small enough to be negligible. The data link layer of the receiver immediately removes the header from the frame and hands the data packet to its network layer, which can also accept the packet immediately. In other words, the receiver can never be overwhelmed with incoming frames.</p><p><strong>Stop and Wait Protocol</strong><br />If data frames arrive at the receiver site faster than they can be processed, the frames must be stored until their use. Normally, the receiver does not have enough storage space, especially if it is receiving data from many sources. This may result in either the discarding of frames or denial of service. To prevent the receiver from becoming overwhelmed with frames,we somehow need to tell the sender to slow down. There must be feedback from the receiver to the sender. The protocol we discuss now is called the Stop and Wait Protocol because the sender sends one frame, stops until it receives confirmation from the receiver (okay to go ahead), and then sends the next frame. We still have unidirectional communication for data frames, but auxiliary ACK frames (simple tokens of acknowledgment) travel from the other direction. We add flow control to our previous protocol.</p><p><strong>NOISY CHANNELS</strong><br /> Although the Stop and Wait Protocol gives us an idea of how to add flow control to its predecessor, noiseless channels are nonexistent. We can ignore the error (as we sometimes do), or we need to add error control to our protocols. We discuss three protocols in this section that use error control.</p><p><strong>Stop and Wait Automatic Repeat Request</strong><br /> Stop and Wait Automatic Repeat Request (Stop and Wait ARQ), adds a simple error control mechanism to the Stop and Wait Protocol. To detect and correct corrupted frames, we need to add redundancy bits to our data frame . When the frame arrives at the receiver site, it is checked and if it is corrupted, it is silently discarded. The detection of errors in this protocol is manifested by the silence of the receiver. Lost frames are more difficult to handle than corrupted ones. In previous protocols, there was no way to identify a frame. The received frame could be the correct one, or a duplicate, or a frame out of order. The solution is to number the frames. When the receiver receives a data frame that is out of order, this means that frames were either lost or duplicated. The comlpted and lost frames need to be resent in this protocol. The sender keeps a copy of the sent frame. At the same time, it starts a timer. If the timer expires and there is no ACK for the sent frame, the frame is resent, the copy is held, and the timer is restarted. Since the protocol uses the stop and wait mechanism, there is only one specific frame that needs an ACK even though several copies of the same frame can be in the network.</p><p><strong>Go Back N Automatic Repeat Request</strong><br />To improve the efficiency of transmission (filling the pipe), multiple frames must be in transition while waiting for acknowledgment. In other words, we need to let more than one frame be outstanding to keep the channel busy while the sender is waiting for acknowledgment. In this section, we discuss one protocol that can achieve this goal; in the next section, we discuss a second. The first is called Go Back N Automatic Repeat Request (the rationale for the name will become clear later). In this protocol we can send several frames before receiving acknowledgments; we keep a copy of these frames until the acknowledgments arrive.', '64', 1, 56, 0, '2014-11-01 04:26:41', 0),

Two features give this method its name. First, there is no scheduled time for a station to transmit. Transmission is random among the stations.

If the number of users are N, the bandwidth is divided into N equal sized portions. Each user is assigned one portion. If the number of users are small and constant, FDM is a simple and efficient allocation mechanism. A telephone trunk can be a simple example of this type. However, when the number of senders is not small and constant or the traffic is heavy, FDM presents some problems. If the spectrum is divided into N regions the number of users currently interested in communicating is less than N, a large piece of valuable spectrum will be wasted.And due to this problem If more than N users want to communicate, some of them will be denied permission for lack of bandwidth. The main reason for lack of bandwidth is that some of the users who have been assigned a frequency band hardly ever transmit or receive anything. So, dividing asinglechannelinto static sub channels is quiet inefficient.The poor performance of static FDM can easily be seen from a simplequeuingtheorycalculation. If the mean time delay is T,fora channelof capacity C bps, with an arrival rate oflambdaframes/sec, each frame having a length drawn from an exponential probability density function with mean 1/1/ bits/frame. With these parameters the arrival rate islambdaframes/sec and the service rate is C frames/sec.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Channel Allocation :</strong><br /> Unlike the static channel,dynamic channel allocation is efficient and is used in areas where the traffic is nonuniform and heavy. Five main assumptions must be considered in dynamic channel allocation.<br /> 1. Station Model: Stations are also called terminals. The number of independent stations are N, with independent constant arrival rates lambda, and probability of a frame being generated in a time interval of (delta t) is (delta t x lambda). Once a frame has been generated the station does nothing until the frame has successfully been transmitted.<br /> 2. Single Channel Assumption:<br /> From hardware point of view, all stations are equal. A single channel is available for communication on which all stations can transmit on it and all can receive from it.<br /> 3. Collision Assumption: If two frames are transmitted simultaneously, they will collide resulting in a false signal. Each station has the ability to detect collision and it must be kept in mind that collided frame must be retransmitted later.<br /> 4. Time Management:<br /> Continuous Time:<br /> Frame transmission can begin at any instant as there is no master clock diving time into discrete intervals.<br /> Slotted Time:<br /> Frame transmission start at the beginning of the time slots. A slot may contain 0,1, or more frame corresponding to an idle, successful or collision transmission respectively.<br /> 5. Sensing of Channel:<br /> Carrier Sense:<br /> A channel can be sensed by station before trying to use it. If a station senses the channel as busy, no station will attempt to use it, until it goes idle.<br /> No Carrier Sense:<br /> Stations cannot sense the channel before trying to use it.

It was designed for a radio (wireless) LAN, but it can be used on anyshared medium.It is obvious that there are potential collisions in this arrangement. The medium isshared between the stations. When a station sends data, another station may attempt todo so at the same time. The data from the two stations collide and become garbled.</p><p><strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access</strong><br />To minimize the chance of collision and, therefore, increase the performance, the CSMA method was developed. The chance of collision can be reduced if a station senses the medium before trying to use it. Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) requires that each station first listen to the medium (or check the state of the medium) before sending. In other words, CSMA is based on the principle "sense before transmit" or "listen before talk." CSMA can reduce the possibility of collision, but it cannot eliminate it. The possibility of collision still exists because of propagation delay; when a station sends a frame, it still takes time (although very short) for the first bit to reach every station and for every station to sense it. In other words, a station may sense the medium and find it idle, only because the first bit sent by another station has not yet been received.</p><p><strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection</strong><br />The CSMA method does not specify the procedure following a collision. Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) augments the algorithm to handle the collision.In this method, a station monitors the medium after it sends a frame to see if the transmission was successful. If so, the station is finished. If, however, there is a collision, the frame is sent again.</p><p><strong>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance</strong><br />Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) The basic idea behind CSMA/CD is that a station needs to be able to receive while transmitting to detect a collision. When there is no collision, the station receives one signal: its own signal. When there is a collision, the station receives two signals: its own signal and the signal transmitted by a second station. To distinguish between these two cases, the received signals in these two cases must be significantly different. In other words, the signal from the second station needs to add a significant amount of energy to the one created by the first station. In a wired network, the received signal has almost the same energy as the sent signal because either the length of the cable is short or there are repeaters that amplify the energy between the sender and the receiver. This means that in a collision, the detected energy almost doubles. However, in a wireless network, much of the sent energy is lost in transmission. The received signal has very little energy. Therefore, a collision may add only 5 to 10 percent additional energy. This is not useful for effective collision detection.', '64', 1, 56, 0, '2014-11-01 04:26:41', 0),

This is a simple, but elegant protocol. The idea is that each station sends a frame whenever it has a frame to send. However, since there is only one channel to share, there is the possibility of collision between frames from different stations.The pure ALOHA protocol relies on acknowledgments from the receiver. When a station sends a frame, it expects the receiver to send an acknowledgment. If the acknowledgment does not arrive after a time out period, the station assumes that the frame (or the acknowledgment) has been destroyed and resends the frame. A collision involves two or more stations. If all these stations try to resend their frames after the time out, the frames will collide again. Pure ALOHA dictates that when the time out period passes, each station waits a random amount of time before resending its frame. The randomness will help avoid more collisions. We call this time the back off time T<sub>B</sub>.Pure ALOHA has a second method to prevent congesting the channel with retransmittedframes.

This is so because there is no rule that defines when the station can send. A station may send soon after another station has started or soon before another station has finished. Slotted ALOHA was invented to improve the efficiency of pure ALOHA. In slotted ALOHA we divide the time into slots of Tfr s and force the station to send only at the beginning of the time slot.Because a station is allowed to send only at the beginning of the synchronized timeslot, if a station misses this moment, it must wait until the beginning of the next timeslot. This means that the station which started at the beginning of this slot has alreadyfinished sending its frame. Of course, there is still the possibility of collision if two stationstry to send at the beginning of the same time slot.

The current station is the one that is accessing the channel now. The right to this access has been passed from the predecessor to the current station. The right will be passed to the successor when the current station has no more data to send. In this method, a special packet called a token circulates through the ring. The possession of the token gives the station the right to access the channel and send its data. When a station has some data to send, it waits until it receives the token from its predecessor. It then holds the token and sends its data. When the station has no more data to send, it releases the token, passing it to the next logical station in the ring. The station cannot send data until it receives the token again in the next round. In this process, when a station receives the token and has no data to send, it just passes the data to the next station. Token management is needed for this access method. Stations must be limited in the time they can have possession of the token.

The purpose of any routing protocol is to dynamically communicate information about all network paths used to reach a destination and to select the from those paths, the best path to reach a destination network. The terms distance vector and link state are used to group routing protocols into two broad categories based on whether the routing protocol selects the best routing path based on a distance metric (the distance) and an interface (the vector), or selects the best routing path by calculating the state of each link in a path and finding the path that has the lowest total metric to reach the destination.<br /> <strong>Distance:</strong> Distance is the cost of reaching a destination, usually based on the number of hosts the path passes through, or the total of all the administrative metrics assigned to the links in the path. <br /><strong>Vector:</strong> From the standpoint of routing protocols, the vector is the interface traffic will be forwarded out in order to reach an given destination network along a route or path selected by the routing protocol as the best path to the destination network. Distance vector protocols use a distance calculation plus an outgoing network interface (a vector) to choose the best path to a destination network. The network protocol (IPX, SPX, IP, Appletalk, DECnet etc.) will forward data using the best paths selected.<br />Routers use distance vectorbased routing protocols to periodically advertise the routes in their routing tables. Routing information exchanged between typical distance vectorbased routers is unsynchronized and unacknowledged.</p><p><strong>Link State</strong> protocols track the status and connection type of each link and produces a calculated metric based on these and other factors, including some set by the network administrator. Link state protocols know whether a link is up or down and how fast it is and calculates a cost to ''get there''. Since routers run routing protocols to figure out how to get to a destination, you can think of the ''link states'' as being the status of the interfaces on the router. Link State protocols will take a path which has more hops, but that uses a faster medium over a path using a slower medium with fewer hops. Because of their awareness of media types and other factors, link state protocols require more processing power (more circuit logic in the case of ASICs) and memory.
